                        <p class="mb-5">SCRUM operates within the agile framework, seamlessly fitting into team workflows. It adapts to your team's needs, enhancing practices for better efficiency. The goal is to empower teams, helping them tackle challenges, boost productivity, and foster innovation.
                        <br/><br/>At the core of Scrum is the Scrum Team—a trio composed of a Product Owner, a Scrum Master, and developers. Together, they participate in five crucial events and create three essential artifacts, as illustrated below.
                        <br/><br/>The term SCRUM perfectly encapsulates the collaborative spirit of the framework. Just as a rugby team huddles in a 'scrum' to advance the ball collectively, Scrum in product development symbolizes the united effort to drive projects forward.</p>
